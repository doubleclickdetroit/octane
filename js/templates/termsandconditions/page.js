	<li>You are granted a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, personal, limited license to install and use the App which will not be: (i) sold,
    leased, rented or otherwise provided to any other third party;(ii) decompiled or reverse engineered (iii) used for the benefit of a third party; or (iv) used
    in the development of any products or services to be provided to a third party. This limited right to use the software is revocable in the discretion of
    WEX and all rights, title and interest not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved.</li><br/>

    <li>App(s) are displayed on wireless web-enabled cell phone or other types of mobile devices ("Mobile Device"). You acknowledge and agree that WEX
    may collect, transmit, store, and use technical, location, and login or other personal data and related information, including but not limited to technical
    information about your device and information regarding your location, that is gathered periodically, to facilitate product support and other services in
    connection with the App.</li><br/>

    <li>App data may be limited to (i) information that is readily available through current WEX systems, (ii) merchant locations where a WEX
    transaction has been authorized in the last six (6) months, and (iii) price information for transactions which have been authorized at that merchant
    location in the last seven (7) days.  WEX is not permitted to include all merchant brands in its price per gallon reporting tools and does not
    guarantee the accuracy of the price per gallon listed at each location.  Price changes occur at the sole discretion of the merchant.</li><br/>

    <li>Due to the wide variety of Mobile Device technology, WEX cannot guarantee that the App will work on all devices.  You may incur additional
    fees or charges from your data carrier for accessing the App. WEX makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the App products,
    transmission channels, or the media on which the App is provided, including but not limited to warranties or accuracy, completeness or fitness for a
    particular purpose.</li><br/>

    <li>Based on the capability of certain Mobile Devices, you may also be able to access tools and functions available to you through certain third party
    licenses that have been granted to WEX.  WEX makes no representations or warranties related to the accuracy or currency of such
    functions and services provide through a third party license. Any maps, directions or other navigation tools are provided for planning purposes only.
    Construction projects, traffic, weather, or other force majeure events may cause conditions to differ from the results, and routes should be planned
    accordingly.</li><br/>

    <li>You agree that you will not use the App or any services related thereto for any purposes prohibited by United States law and shall not use or otherwise
    export or re-export the App software. In no event will WEX or any affiliate be liable for indirect, consequential or special damages, including
    lost profits, arising from your use of the App service, even if such damages were reasonably foreseeable and notice was given regarding them. These
    limitations will apply to all causes of action, whether arising from breach of contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory.</li><br/>
